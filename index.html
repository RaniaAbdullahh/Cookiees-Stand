        <p id="par">
            I have always loved to bake. It is something that runs in my family. My grandma used to make the best cheesecake I have ever had. Of course, she used the best ingredient: "grandma's love".... 
            I moved from Argentina to Zurich with my husband and my little son a long time ago. Being away from home, every now and then I would miss my family, my friends back there, our typical food with "homey taste".....That was when I came up with the idea of bringing my "home Argentinean flavours" to Switzerland. I would make a cake and suddenly, like magic, the delicious smell of freshly baked cheesecake would fill the kitchen and would transport me back home. To the joy of my childhood. To the love of my far away family. To my beloved Grandmother. As my second child was born, I decided to leave my profession aside and take pastry courses. Much to the delight of my family, I cultivated my passion for desserts from back home, including the ones I love the most with dulce de leche (our version of caramel), and I incorporated new styles of baking and decoration. Word started to spread among friends and neighbors, who all loved my grandma's secret cheesecake recipe. That is when I was encouraged to take my hobby to the next level.
